	  Vuurmuur is a firewall manager built on top of iptables on Linux.
	
	  It has a simple and easy to learn user interface that allows both simple 
	  and complex configurations. The configuration can be fully made through 
	  an Ncurses GUI, which allows secure remote administration over SSH or on 
	  the console. Vuurmuur supports traffic shaping and has powerful monitoring 
	  features, which allow the administrator to look at the logs, connections 
	  and bandwidth usage in realtime.

		This ebuild contains the libraries and shared components for Vuurmuur.
